112.0 - 2021.09.19
------------------
Deprecated KIS support
Added the PackRat Mk2 - a complete refresh of the PackRat Rover!
- Includes a few new parts, like two RTGs, and two generators (LF+Atm, Mono)
- Includes options for a 'long wheelbase' version with extra battery storage
- The mini wheel is now less responsive and slower than it's stock counterpart
The old PackRat has been moved to a LegacyParts folder in the download.
Added twelve new science parts!  Huge thanks to Kerbals_of_Steel for the flavor text!

1.4.0 - 2020.12.20
------------------
KSP 1.11 Compatibility
The Packrat seat now has a crew capacity so it can be loaded in the VAB.
The Packrat FRONT Chassis has a new bottom attachment node that you can use to snap onto a KAS concrete block as a starting point for KIS/KAS assembly
Added some additional nodes to the Packrat to ease assembly with KAS/KIS (no more having to rotate - just cycle through nodes!)
Packrats got easier to... pack?  You can now squeeze the Packrat into a pair of KIS SC-62 Containers.
Packrat part masses have been normalized to facilitate balanced KIS packing accross two radial containers.
The Packrat has had it's stability dramatically increased.  Parts also have a higher mass.
The Packrat built in RTG got a power boost to account for the mass increase and resource consumption.
DERP rebalances
- DERP service ring is heavier
- DERP rings now have an adjusted 
- DERP pod no longer has a parachute
